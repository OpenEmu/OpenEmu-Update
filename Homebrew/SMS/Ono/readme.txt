Story
-----

You are a white circle. You shoot bullets all day long. You wish the world were
more white, like you. But it is all black. This makes you sad.

One day, some evil coloured circles started appearing around the edges of your
world. When your bullets hit them, some of their colour fell off onto the
ground. When your bullets hit them some more, they split into two smaller
circles! And when you shot them, they split too! But the tiniest coloured

circles didn't split, they just ran out of colour and disappeared.

As you idly blasted them into oblivion you noticed something surprising: red,
green and blue colours could mix to produce others! Red and green made yellow,
red and blue made purple... and when you had enough of all of them, it made
wonderful, glorious white! This made you happy.

So you took on a new mission: turn the world 100% white.

I realise the story might sound somewhat racially charged if you were prone to
read unnecessary things into an innocent pile of crap story. So don't.
